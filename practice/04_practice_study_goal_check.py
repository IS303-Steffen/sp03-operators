OPTIONAL AI GUIDANCE PROMPT:
----------------------------
I am a student in an introductory Python class. I am learning many coding
principles for the very first time. I am going to paste in the instructions to
a practice problem that my professor gave me to try before class. Please be my
kind tutor and walk me through how to solve the problem step by step.

Don't just give me the full solution all at once (unless I later ask for it).
Instead, help me work through it gradually, with clear explanations and small,
easy-to-understand examples. Please use everyday language and explain things
in a simple, friendly way.


INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
You are building a simple tracker to check if you are on track with your
study goals.

1. Ask the user how many hours they studied today.
2. Convert the input to a float.
3. Compare whether the hours studied is at least 2.
4. Print out a sentence like: "Met goal? True" or "Met goal? False"
